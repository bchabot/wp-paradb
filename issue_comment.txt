Implemented in #29. This PR splits the 'Reports' feature into distinct 'Reports' and 'Activities'. The database schema has been updated with a new 'activities' table, and the 'reports' table modified to link to activities. New handler classes and admin interfaces have been created/modified accordingly. Due to environment limitations, comprehensive testing could not be performed, and further testing in a live WordPress environment is recommended.
