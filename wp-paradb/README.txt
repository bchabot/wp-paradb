Plugin to add reporting, archiving, and search functionality for paranormal investigation

== Description ==

Plugin to add reporting, archiving, and search functionality for paranormal investigations and (in the future) also anomaly witness reporting and parapsychological experiments.
The long term goal is to establish a large shared database.  It may be a single point of truth or it may be federated. 
For experiments and investigations peer reviewing may be added. 
== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
